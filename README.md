In this Code Pattern, we will use German Credit data to train, create, and deploy a machine learning model using 
[Watson Machine Learning](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/machine-learning). We will create a data mart for this model with 
[Watson OpenScale](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-openscale/) and configure OpenScale to monitor that deployment,
and inject seven days' worth of historical records and measurements for viewing in the OpenScale Insights dashboard.
